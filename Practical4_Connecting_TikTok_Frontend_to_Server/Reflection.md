- **Protected Routes**: Conditional rendering and access control based on authentication status

#### 3. API Client Architecture
- **Axios Configuration**: Centralized HTTP client with interceptors
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Separated API calls into dedicated service modules
- **Error Handling**: Global error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- **Environment Configuration**: Proper use of environment variables for API endpoints

#### 4. State Management Patterns
- **React Context**: Global state management for authentication
- **Component State**: Local state for forms and UI interactions
- **API State**: Handling loading, success, and error states for API calls

#### 5. Component Architecture
- **Reusable Components**: Modal, forms, and UI components designed for reusability
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between UI, business logic, and API calls
- **Props and State Flow**: Proper data flow between parent and child components

#### 6. Social Media Features Implementation
- **Feed Systems**: Implementation of "For You" and "Following" feeds
- **User Interactions**: Like, comment, follow/unfollow functionality
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic UI updates based on user actions
- **File Upload**: Video and image upload with validation

### Challenges Faced and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: CORS Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Initial API requests were blocked due to CORS policy violations.

**Symptoms**:
- Network requests failing with CORS errors
- Authentication requests being blocked
- Frontend unable to communicate with backend

**Solution**:
- Configured CORS middleware in Express.js backend
- Added proper origin headers for development environment
- Ensured preflight requests were handled correctly

**Learning**: Understanding browser security policies and proper CORS configuration is crucial for full-stack applications.

#### Challenge 2: Authentication State Persistence
**Problem**: User authentication state was lost on page refresh.

**Symptoms**:
- Users being logged out on browser refresh
- Authentication context not initializing properly
- Protected routes not working correctly

**Solution**:
- Implemented localStorage for token persistence
- Added initialization logic in AuthContext
- Created token validation on application startup

**Learning**: Client-side state persistence requires careful consideration of storage mechanisms and initialization patterns.

#### Challenge 3: API Error Handling
**Problem**: Inconsistent error handling across different API calls.

**Symptoms**:
- Some errors not being displayed to users
- Application crashes on certain API failures
- Inconsistent error message formats

**Solution**:
- Implemented global error interceptor in Axios configuration
- Created standardized error handling patterns
- Added user-friendly error messages with react-hot-toast

**Learning**: Centralized error handling improves user experience and application reliability.

#### Challenge 4: Component State Management
**Problem**: Complex state management between parent and child components.

**Symptoms**:
- Props drilling through multiple component levels
- Inconsistent state updates
- Difficulty tracking state changes

**Solution**:
- Utilized React Context for global state
- Implemented custom hooks for reusable logic
- Established clear data flow patterns

**Learning**: Proper state management architecture is essential for maintainable React applications.

#### Challenge 5: File Upload Implementation
**Problem**: Video file uploads were failing or taking too long.

**Symptoms**:
- Large file uploads timing out
- Progress indication not working
- File validation issues

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper file validation on frontend
- Added upload progress indicators
- Configured appropriate timeout settings

**Learning**: File upload requires careful consideration of file size limits, validation, and user feedback.

### Key Insights

1. **Architecture Importance**: Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns makes debugging and feature addition much easier.

2. **User Experience Focus**: Proper loading states, error handling, and feedback mechanisms are crucial for professional applications.

3. **Security Mindset**: Authentication and authorization must be considered at every level of the application.

4. **Testing Strategy**: Having multiple user accounts for testing social features is essential for comprehensive testing.

5. **Documentation Value**: Clear documentation and code organization significantly improve development efficiency.

### Future Improvements
